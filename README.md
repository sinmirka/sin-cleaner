## 💻 Development Recommendation / Source Running

It is recommended to run the project using an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or any other Python-compatible IDE because it is more stable and easier to debug.

For a cleaner and safer setup, it is also recommended to use a virtual environment.

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate (Windows):

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Activate (macOS/Linux):

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
